#Direct Democracy - Abstract

A society needs a means of decision making, that is fair to every participant of it.

The only way to achieve this, is to give every participant a voice. But a problem must not only be approached from a personal perspective, but also from abstracted entities of a society, the organs of the collective.

These organs are:

- The disciplines

- The politicians

- The public

Using modern technology, it is possible to employ a transparent and easy way of electing and voting.
